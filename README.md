## Getting started 


you ned to export the cache size 

```cpp
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
```

### Building the frontend

1- installing dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

2- install translations

```bash
./script/setup_translations 
```

3- install bootstrap

```bash
./script/bootstrap 
```

4- setup the project 

```bash
./script/setup
```

5- build the frontend , when executing this command , the frontend source codes will be generated under hass_frontend directory

```bash
./script/build_frontend 
```



now here to test the frontend you gonna need the home assistant working container assume the container called homeassistant ,then you need to copy the built frontend folder to the original folder

in my case was:-

```bash
sudo docker cp Downloads/HA-frontend-dev/hass_frontend/  homeassistant:/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/
```

6- restart the docker container

```bash
sudo docker restart homeassistant
```


thats it
